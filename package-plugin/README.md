# Package plugin action

This GitHub Action automates the process of packaging Grafana plugins. It takes the source code of a Grafana plugin and transforms it into an archive file, preparing it for distribution.

## Features

- Builds Grafana plugin source code into an archive for distribution.
- Supports signing the plugin if a Grafana access token policy is provided.

## Usage

- Add this workflow to your GitHub repository as in the example.
- Set up the necessary environment variables and secrets, including the Grafana access token policy (if signing is desired).
- The action will build the plugin and create an archive that can be used by further steps of your workflow.

## Examples

### Package and upload the plugin

This workflow will trigger on pushes to the `main` branch. Use this workflow if you want to build plugins from your `main` branch as artifacts without creating a release.

To build, package and release in a single action use [build-plugin](https://github.com/grafana/plugin-actions/tree/main/build-plugin)

```yaml
name: Package plugin and upload artifact

  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Run workflow on pushes to `main`
